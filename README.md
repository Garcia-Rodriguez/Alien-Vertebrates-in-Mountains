# Alien-Vertebrates-in-Mountains
Data and codes for the analyses implemented in: The global status of alien vertebrates in mountains. Garcia-Rodriguez et al. 

This repository contains:
1. DataPredictors.csv (Values overall alien richness and alien richness for each taxonomic group as well as the quantified predictors for the mountains studied)
 
2. GLM.R (GLMs implemented to identify the predictors that better explaining the variation in alien richness across mountains worlwide).

3. Flows.R (Code for the analysis of alien vertebrate flows among realms)

4. Nullmod_Flows.R (Null models developed to identify higher or lower than expected flows)
